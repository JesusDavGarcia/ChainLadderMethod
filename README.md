  <p align="center">
    The purpose of this document is to implement the CRISP-DM methodology for a hypothetical "Chain Ladder Method Project for Provision Estimation" for the company Chubb Limited. More specifically, it will follow IBM´s steps for the implementation of the CRISP-DM process. The company´s information was obtained from its Annual Report and its webpage. This project might include hypothetical information in order to simulate the business case.
